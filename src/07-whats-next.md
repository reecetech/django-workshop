# What's Next

We now have a blog which allows us to create and view posts. We have also learned how to manage our
posts through the Django Admin interface. Functionality that would be nice to add would be:

* Deleting posts
* Updating posts
* Styling your site using CSS

We encourage you to try doing these on your own. If you want to go even further, we highly recommend
then [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) which covers many other important
topics including using source control, publishing your code to GitHub and deploying your code on the
web.
